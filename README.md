#GMScreen ([demo](http://ryankinal.github.com/GMScreen/))

GMScreen IS a fully customizable dashboard for tables, lists, and notes targeted at Pencil-and-Paper (or, more likely, computer-pencil-and-paper) RPG game masters, story-tellers, and dungeon-masters.

Besides require.js, all code is my own.

##Recent Additions

Some cool features that have recently been added!

###Hotkeys - 12/6

* Start by hitting `ctrl + ;` - this activates hot keys
* Hit `w` to add a window to the current screen
* Hit `s` to add a new screen
* Hit `esc` to close any modal window (whether hotkeys are active or not)

More of these to come eventually!

##Future Features

Awesome stuff that will be available in the future

###Local Storage

This will mean all your screens are saved *right in your browser*. No account. No password. Just persistent screens and windows.

###Cloud Storage

This will mean that everything that saves in your browser will also (optionally) be stored on a server. You'll be able to switch from device to device and still have access to all your screens, but it will require an account.

###More Hotkeys

Yep.

###Dice

Yep
