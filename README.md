#GMScreen ([demo](http://ryankinal.github.com/GMScreen/))

GMScreen IS a fully customizable dashboard for tables, lists, and notes targeted at Pencil-and-Paper (or, more likely, computer-pencil-and-paper) RPG game masters, story-tellers, and dungeon-masters.

Besides require.js, all code is my own.

##Recent Additions

Some cool features that have recently been added!

###Local Storage - 12/8

Whenever you do *anything* it is immediately saved to your browser. This includes:

* Adding a new screen
* Adding a new window
* Moving a window
* Shading a window
* Adding and editing table rows and columns
* Adding and editing list items
* Sorting tables
* Moving list items
* Marking list items and table rows
* Deleting list items and table rows
* **Basically anything you do**

And, when you return to the page, your changes will be loaded for you.

###Improved marking - 12/8

I've improved the way data is represented in tables and lists, so a marked row or item will remain marked when sorting and moving.

###Hotkeys - 12/6

* Start by hitting `ctrl + ;` - this activates hot keys
* Hit `w` to add a window to the current screen
* Hit `s` to add a new screen
* Hit `esc` to close any modal window (whether hotkeys are active or not)

More of these to come eventually!

##Future Features

Awesome stuff that will be available in the future

###Cloud Storage

This will mean that everything that saves in your browser will also (optionally) be stored on a server. You'll be able to switch from device to device and still have access to all your screens, but it will require an account.

###More Hotkeys

Yep.

###Dice

Yep
